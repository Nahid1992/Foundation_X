<!-- # Integrating Classification, Localization, and Segmentation through Lock-Release Pretraining Strategy for Chest X-ray Analysis -->

Developing deep-learning models for medical imaging requires large, annotated datasets, but the heterogeneity of annotations across tasks presents significant challenges. Foundation X is an end-to-end framework designed to train a multi-task foundation model by leveraging diverse expert-level annotations from multiple public datasets. It introduces a Cyclic & Lock-Release pretraining strategy alongside a student-teacher learning paradigm to enhance knowledge retention while mitigating overfitting. Trained on 11 chest X-ray datasets, Foundation X seamlessly integrates classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate its ability to maximize annotation utility, improve cross-dataset and cross-task learning, and achieve superior performance in disease classification, localization, and segmentation.
